# Notes on the HW: Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio


* Firstly I created 3 different HTML files, representing each page in the portfolio (Index for the home screen, and porfolio and contact respectively.)
* Next, considering that each of these pages will basically need to have the same look, I used Bootstrap to grab a Nav bar for each page and changed the names to fit each required page. 
* I linked each of the tab on this nav bar to each of the HTML files, so when you click on each tab, you are taken to a new place 
* Next, I used a card which took up 9 columns, for a brief bio of myself on my Index HTML 
* I was able to also use cards for my portfolio and then complete a brief descriptions and used <a> tags to link to my GitHub Repositories 
* Lastly for my contact page, I used a bootstrap form to set a basic layout of what I wanted to include in a contact form. 
* Styled to all take up a simialar theme (gainsboro * #f2f2f2)
* Notes in CSS File of design markup
